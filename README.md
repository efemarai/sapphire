Little gems that we give freely to the world

This repo hosts publicly available dev-resources, e.g. a script that helps bootstrap a plain vanilla debian EC2 instance so that it can use docker and authenticated git. You can run this script by executing the following three lines in a shell on the instance you want to bootstrap:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/efemarai/sapphire/main/bootstrap/docker_and_authorized_git.sh
chmod +x docker_and_authorized_git.sh
./docker_and_authorized_git.sh
```
